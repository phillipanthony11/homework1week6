# homework1week6

## Description:

This project was to have a command line that generated an HTML page with cards that listed Name, Employee type, id#, email, and name. The manager also required office number, the intern school and the engineer github. Functions had to be written to fill the information in the provided generate HTML. I used switch cases to address the different catergories.
